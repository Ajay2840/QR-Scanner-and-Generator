# QR Generator & Scanner

Simple client-side web app to generate QR codes and scan them using the device camera.

## Files
- `index.html` â€” main UI
- `styles.css` â€” styles
- `script.js` â€” javascript logic, uses `qrcodejs` for generation and `html5-qrcode` for scanning

  ## ðŸš€ Features

- **Generate QR Codes** instantly from text/URLs  
- **Download** generated QR codes as PNG images  
- **Live Scan** QR codes with your device camera  
- **Copy** scanned results to clipboard in one click  
- 100% **Client-Side** â€” no data stored or sent to servers  
- **Responsive** design for mobile & desktop  

## How to use
1. Clone or download the files and open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. For scanning, allow the page to access the camera.

## Notes
- The scanner depends on `html5-qrcode` which works well on mobile and desktop browsers that expose cameras.
- If camera permission is denied, the scanner will not start.
